(Once you reach the alleyway, you enter a cutscene. Blimbus walks to the entrance and stops when he notices (mystery arp) that a weird pop up shop mysteriously appeared where it wasn’t before. He notices it almost seems built into the wall, already showing signs of weathering… strange. Blimbus, absolutely befuddled, walks up to the shops entrance and reads the sign.)  
  
B: “Back Alley Bargains… odd.”  
  
(He opens the door and walks inside, he steps forward slowly, as if to be cautious. Looking ahead, he sees a cashiers desk with no register and a singular rotary phone. The phone lets out a reverberated ring. Blimbus looks behind him to see the door wide open, sees that there’s nobody in sight, and picks up the phone, lifting it to what would be his ear. A mysterious grumbled voice simply utters…)  
  
MM: “Behind you.”  
(Startled, he jerks his head backwards and finds the door has disappeared, and is a solid wall. Blimbus, shaken, stares back at the phone, the receiver still held up to his ear. A dark, tall, looming presence rises over Blimbus, smiling wide. The figure reaches a purple sleeved arm out to the receiver, and 2 chartreuse green fingers poke out and gently pull back Blimbus’ hand, laying the receiver onto the phone, hanging up the call. The looming presence, instantly shifting attitude, now speaks.)  
  
MM: “Welcome to Back Alley Bargains, where you can get your contraband cheap.”  
MM: “Can I help ya’ find anything?”  
  
(Blimbus lets out a short breath, genuinely awestruck, before speaking.)  
  
B: “If I had a nickel for every time I met a mysterious, dubious creature in this very alleyway… I-”  
  
MM: “You’d have 2 nickels?”  

B: “... Yeah, I would.”  
  
MM: “You would.”

B: “Um… you got some big hands there, sir.”  
  
(Mystery Man holds up his hand, twisting it.)  
  
MM: “Looks about the same size it was yesterday, and the day before, ya’ get the deal.”  
(He grins a toothy grin, splaying his fingers, Blimbus is wide eyed.)  
  
MM: “So, how can I help you today? Or rather, how could you help me?”  
  
B: “Hmm?”  
  
MM: “Nevermind all that.”  
MM: “I assume something very specific drew you to this alley, hmm?  
  
B: “You could say that.”  
  
MM: “I just did.” (funny smile)  
MM: “Have you ever felt like you did something bad, but at the time, you didn’t know it was bad, and now you’re scrambling to find the source of the issue and… bottle it up?”

B: “Yeah, that’s like- exactly my problem.”  
  
MM: “I’m sure it is, Blimbus.”  
  
B: “Wa-wa-wait How do you know my name?”  
  
MM: “Word gets around.”

MM: “I do think I have an answer for your problem, though.”  
MM: “Ya’ know, I see things. Lots of things. What you did in that there alley, for instance.”  
MM: “That… thing… you released… is bad news blues, amigo.”  
MM: “Bluer than you, I’m afraid.”  
MM: “See, this thing wants to eat. No, it has to eat.”  
MM: “What happened to that innocent man earlier today, that ‘strange black residue’ is all too familiar isn’t it?”  
MM: “We both know that you know.”  
MM: “Now lemme tell ya.’”  
MM: “You’ve got a long road ahead of you.”  
MM: “This brand of Armageddon doesn’t just go away in a day.”  
MM: “Better hope you filled up your tank.”  
MM: “...and lucky you! The first stop on this road… was meeting me.”  
MM: “Only took 34 years… your grand mistake.”  
  
B: “I uh… I don’t get it.”  
  
MM: “Of course you don’t” - smiling  
MM: “Before I continue, you thirsty?”  
  
B: “Yeah I could drink.”  
  
(Mystery Man pulls from under his desk an already filled cup, extending his arm to Blimbus. Blimbus swirls the liquid, seeing its blue hue. He takes a huge swig, smacking his lips in distaste.)  
  
B: “Uh… what is this?”  
  
MM: “Antifreeze, tasty stuff huh?”  
  
(Blimbus wipes his tongue with his hand before downing the rest of the glass, as to not be rude, letting out a weird sigh while he sets the glass on Mystery Man’s desk.)

MM: “Now, like I was saying. That thing is no more alive than its victim is now.”  
MM: “McSomething or other, was it?”  
MM: “It’s motivated by one thing.”  
MM: “Survival.”  
MM: “Unfortunately for us, survival is a zero-sum game when it comes to this thing.”  
MM: “For it to persist, we… you… need to die.”  
  
B: “Me like me specifically??”  
  
MM: “No.”  
  
B: “Uh… ok.”  
  
MM: “It has an unending hunger it can never seem to satisfy.”  
MM: “.. and it’s your job to make sure it can’t make it to supper.”  
MM: “We call this thing Tenebris.”  
  
B: “Who is ‘we?’”

MM: “Doesn’t matter right now.”  
MM: “What does matter, however, is finding Tenebris before another innocent man gets turned into an organ smoothie.  
  
B: “So, what do I do?”  
  
MM: laughing softly “Find it, of course.”

MM: “Do you remember seeing it go anywhere?”  
  
B: “Yeah… it slunk away into a vent after it stared at me a bunch.”

  
MM: “Then I think you know where to start looking.”  
  
(The phone begins to ring again. Blimbus looks down at the phone, then back to MM.)  
  
MM: “It’s for you.”  
  
(Blimbus stares at the phone, slowly picking it up. As he looks back up, Mystery Man is gone. There was no voice on the other end, just static and a dial tone. Blimbus looks behind him, and the door is now back and opened. Yet mysteriously, warm yellow light pours in through the opening, it was daytime. Blimbus walks out into the open daylight, looking out of the alleyway and noticing a weird lack of cheerful smiles on the passing Bophites faces. He pivots to close the door but is shocked to find that the entire entrance has mysteriously vanished.)  
  
B: “That couldn’t have just been a dream, huh…”  
B: “I guess I really do need to look into this Tenebris thing.”  
  
(What was strange is that Blimbus still felt like he was holding the currently vanished doorknob, he looks to his hand and sees a strange punchcard grasped lightly. Yada Yada details it’s your true ending card, there’s one stamp out in the shape of a large brimmed hat.)
