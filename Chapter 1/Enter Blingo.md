Setting: Scrimbo's apartment on Crime Street.

Scrimbo jolts awake to the sound of a blaring alarm and a commanding pounding from his front door. He srunches his face and blinks, groaning loudly. He looks to his alarm, scowling and slamming it into his nightstand, breaking it in the process. 

Still in his nightgown, he walks to his front door, rubbing his face with his hand, with his other on the doorknob. He opens it, and Blingo's theme begins to play.

The camera pans from the bottom of Blingo to the top, showing off his... bling, and zooming out to show his two henchmen behind him, Scrimbo in the corner of the screen.

"SCRIMBO!!!" Blingo spits. 
"You look like shit." He says matter of factly.

"You woke me up." Scrimbo retorts with a grovely voice.

"The rent?" Blingo asks with an outstretched hand, ignoring Scrimbo's previous comment.

Scrimbo sighs, "Listen man, I don't have all of it, if you could just give me a couple days-"

"Listen buddy, I make the rules, and the rules SAY you gotta have your rent... right now." Blingo cuts Scrimbo off.
"Shivlad, tell him what we do to scrubs who pay their rent late." He says, gesturing over his shoulder at a tall Bophite. Shivlad cracks his knuckles, grunting at Scrimbo, who gives a confused expression in response, sharing a look with a smug Blingo.

"You'll get yer ass beat." Blingo says, his smile dropped.
"You're supposed to say- ugh nevermind." Blingo says to Shivlad, he continues.
"Point is, rent's due, Scrimbo, but since I'm so nice, I'll give you a *small* extension." Blingo says while putting a hand on Scrimbo's shoulder, who whacks it off to absolutely no reaction from Blingo. (This will become a running joke)

"Yeah, whatever, I'll have it in a few days, promise." Scrimbo says dismissively, beginning to walk away and shut the door. It's ripped from his hands by Blingo's other henchman, to which Scrimbo curses him.

"You *will* have your rent, by THIS TIME next week... or an eviction notice will be the last thing you got to worry about." Blingo says with a smug grin on his face. 

Scrimbo slouches, sighing. "Yup, thanks Blingo."

"Awesome, later loser." Blingo says, a beat after before Blingo elbows his henchman, who slams Scrimbo's door in response. Scrimbo flinches, left staring at his door, dumbfounded and exhausted.

"How does a guy get his own fucking door slammed in his face?" Scrimbo says to himself in disbelief.
