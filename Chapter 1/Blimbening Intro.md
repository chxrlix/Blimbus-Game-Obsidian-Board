(We open on a bright cloudy sky, where we get the initial FADS bumper and the chapter 1 intro logo. The camera pans into Blimbus’ house where he is asleep. An alarm clock next to him gracefully chimes a harp arpeggio, where Blimbus physically bounces awake with a smile. He lightly taps his alarm and his theme song begins to play. We cut to a street view with Blimbus walking down waving to all the Bophites and smiling, seeing the bustling city while he makes his way to Donny’s. The narrator opens.)  
  
N: “Ahh, what a beautiful day - in Jimple City.”

N: “On this sunny sunrise, we follow our titular protagonist, Blimbus B. Blimbleblam.”

N: “Watch this lovely blue man go, waving at all the neighborly Bophites.”

N: “Today, Blimbus is jaunting a jaunty jaunt to his favorite breakfast joint, Donny’s.”

N: “Ha, can a man get any happier?”  
(Record Scratch)  
N: “No no seriously, can life get ANY better than thiiiii… oh?”

(Blimbus is left staring down a dark alleyway, with a visible gloomy aura permeating from the entrance. He is drawn to it, and begins to walk down the hauntingly horrible path.)

B: “Curiosity killed the cat y’know…”  
B: “Good thing I’m Blimbus!”

(You gain control of Blimbus and walk down the alley to find a mysterious bottle filled with a perma-black liquid. Blimbus innocently walks up to the bottle, picks it up, and holds it to the light, noticing none of it is passing through.)

B: “Wow, weird bottle, huh?”

(Back to cutscene, the bottle begins to rumble in his hand, where he drops it and steps back like a sissy. Upon impact, the cap flies off and hits the wall with a tap, the black liquid barreling out of the neck of the bottle. The black goop, consolidating into one mass, begins to have a weird head formation stick out of the main ‘body.’ Blimbus, frozen with curiosity, simply stares at the gathering mass wide eyed.)  
  
B: “Uh… what a silly little blob creature… I guess?”
  
(The creature instantly reacts to the sound of Blimbus’ voice, the head-like formation snapping while the mass slowly lurches forward. It barrels right past Blimbus, who darts out of the way, and it collides with an animal near the entrance who unfortunately happened to be walking by. We see the creature slowly roll back to its previous position, resting in front of Blimbus, where we see an eye bubble to the surface and roll to face Blimbus. It tests a few rapid blinks, before giving a large gooey one.)  
  
B: “... Aww, it’s kinda cute!”  
  
(The creature blinks at Blimbus again before creeping backwards into a vent embedded in the alley wall, slinking itself into the nearby sewer.)  
  
B: “Um… I’m sure that’ll be fine!”


(Blimbus resumes his jauntingly jaunty jaunt, and Narrator picks back up.)  
  
N: clears throat “Well.. that was uh… something.”

N: “Blimbus resumed his morning walk, and made his way to Donny’s.”
