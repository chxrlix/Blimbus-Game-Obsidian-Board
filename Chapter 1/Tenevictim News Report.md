B: “Ahhh. That humble homey home smell, gotta love it.”  
B: “I still don’t have a nose.”  
  
(Blimbus walks through his house, a weird montage of him walking through the living room brushing his teeth, putting on his sleep hat, then going to lock the door, when he sees the news.)  
  
B: “Wha..?”  
  
(The report onscreen shows a random Bophite with a large comical red X over their picture. The reporter continues their story)  
  
R: “-in Jimple City today where a… horrible murder has just been discovered. A young man named Hickle McSqueezy has been found mangled and bruised all over in an alleyway just behind Nowhere St. An odd part about this discovery, though, is that all of his organs seemed to be cleanly harvested, yet a weird, black, unexplained residue could be seen along the walls of what was one Mr. McSqueezy’s skin. Jimply City officials have stated there are no witnesses, no apparent footprints leading to or from the murder scene, and no foreign Bophite DNA in the surrounding area. Strangest of all, however, is that his family called in saying he left the house slumping, not acting like himself at all, and refusing to speak.”  
  
R: “And now onto more important news… SPORTS!!!”

B: “C-Could that have been that… that silly black thing?”  
B: “Fffffffffffiddlesticks.”  
B: “I - I gotta do somethin’ bout this.”**
