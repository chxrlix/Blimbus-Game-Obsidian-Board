Scrimbo, where he would usually wake up from his nightmare, is greeted in a dimly lit open area, seemingly with a shallow puddle rippling, yet, no noise. His vision is slightly blurred and aberrated, unable to see crisp detail, but enough to be spatially aware. Scrimbo looks to the puddle, and beyond his reflection, he sees a piano, turning to face it. When it begins to play, his vision clears. Pure insight.

"Wh.... Hello?" Scrimbo says, looking around skeptically.

"Be not afraid, kiddo." Says Mystery Man with a scant smile.

Almost poetically, he jumps in surprise, whipping his head back to come face to face with none other than Mystery Man, who hadn't been in the piano seat before. With Scrimbo's surprise, the sky itself seemed to react, as if tied to his state of thought

"Fuck dude, you again? You scared the life out of me."

"I said be not afraid." He says with a light chuckle under his words.

"Oh sorry, maybe it's the magic appeary thingy, or maybe it's the fact I have no clue where I am, but I am in fact a little frightened." Scrimbo retorts matter of factly, a slight irritation lining his voice.
"I should’ve woken up from…" He doesn’t let himself finish. “Where are we?”

"We aren't anywhere, pal -- Although I suppose we ain't exactly nowhere either..."

Scrimbo tilts his head, squinting his eyes at Mystery Man to indicate confusion.

"I mean just think about it -- If we were nowhere, we'd still be some place, yea? Doesn't seem so nowhere to me."

"So what's your point, and when am I gonna start getting some answers?" Scrimbo questions.

"I'm afraid you already know all the answers. I'm the one in the dark here! So let me ask you -- Where exactly is this, Scrimbo?"

Scrimbo scoffed, but humored the mysterious, testosterone ridden individual. He stared up into the sky and toward the distant horizons of nothing, watching the colors and hue shift as his impatience grows.

"Looks... no... feels like my brain, but that feels like the easy answer, and it's never that easy. 'Specially for dudes like me." Scrimbo looks down to the swaying grass.

"You're phrasing that as if I could tell you if you're right or wrong. Guess we really are just both lost here, huh?"
"Lost nowhere..."
"But like I said, nowhere's gotta be somewhere"
"But I don't think that really matters right now."
"Tell me -- isn't this nowhere place better than where you usually end up?"

We get a shot of Scrimbo's torso, where he sits down in the grass, showing that there are golden tears streaming down his face, devoid of feeling or impact on his emotional state or voice. Those golden tears stream down into the grass in a small pool in front of Scrimbo.

"... I don't want to go back, you're right." Scrimbo admits.

"Worry not -- You don't have to ever again."
"You know what that other place is, yes?"

"I think I have an idea..." He rubs his thumb on his cheek, raising it out in front of him to look at the golden tears.

"Put it on me, kid."

"It's... dark. But also not. Not humid, not dry. Not cold, not hot. The only thing I feel is that... thing being ripped from my chest. I keep telling myself it's just a nightmare, but something about it feels so real. I don't want it to be real." 
The tears streaming from his face turn from slightly transparent to opaque, symbolic of real tears.
“I'm so angry, and I don't know why, and I want it to stop. It's just..."

"Scary..."

Scrimbo gives a silent nod in response.

"Your pain is like no others'..."
"So real, but just out of the grasp of memory..."
"You don't even know what you're scared of -- or rather who."

"But how will I ever find that out?"
"You don't seem to know anything here, and I've spent the better half of 20 years slouching around being an angry asshole. No dice."

"The day will come, but that day isn't this one, or the next, or even the next."
"Your breed of wrath doesn't just come from ill circumstances alone, but something much more visceral."
"However, it's not your business in solving the case, just living in spite of it."

"If I'm so scared of it, and it looks like there's no way to stop that, then what's the point?"

"It's only as scary as you'll let it be."
"The point is simple: we are both here, are we not? So hear the music, breathe in each measure, and exhale each note one at a time...."
"You may not think it; but in some ways I envy you, Scrimbo."

Scrimbo looks back at Mystery Man, surprise on his face, the tears down to a mere drip, but still opaque.

"You have one thing I could never have; and that's the ability to choose."
"You have so many opportunities in front of you, and you don't even realize because you're getting all choked up over something you cannot even control."
"Well...?"

Scrimbo stands up, meeting Mystery Man's gaze for a beat, where he then sets his hands down on the piano, not just feeling the vibrations but truly feeling the music like MM said. The final opus comes to a head, and as one last tear drips onto the piano, it stops. Scrimbo isn't smiling, Scrimbo isn't frowning. He's not angry, he's not scared. He's Scrimbo... for what feels like the first time in his life.

"Just remember, us folks bleed the same, and it makes us who we are."
