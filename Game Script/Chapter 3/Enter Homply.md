*Setting: Scrimbo is tied to a fixture in the middle of a dank room within the Crimson Cult bunker. He pulls at his restraints, feeling that he is trapped. He surveys the room, finding a rusty, ominous door. It opens, letting in a red glow (from random bulbs on random boxes) that outlines Homply.*

*Shaken, and with a terrible headache, Scrimbo asks,* "where... am I?"

_The silhouette trudges into the room, slinking across the wall to a rusty panel with maligned buttons. The door slams shut with the press of one of these buttons, causing the figure to wince. He turns around and stares at Scrimbo, his eyes pinpricks in the darkness._ "Unimportant." _He says, his word(s) shaky and monotone._

_Still dazed, Scrimbo tries looking around, noticing the dark, damp atmosphere of the sewer, but a place he has not seen before. Lining the rooms are a multitude of gasoline canisters, most half-empty. The echoes whirring of water seems to almost cleanse Scrimbo of his headache._ "who the fuck are you...?"

_The figure lets out a small snorty giggle, the clatter of surgical tools indicating he lost his footing._ "Can't you feel it? The _passion_… the _devotion_… the _**chaos?**_" _He says as he inches closer to the dingy light illuminating Scrimbo. Homply's face, in all it's fucked up glory, makes itself known to Scrimbo._ "I... am your greatest follower, Homply, my god." _He says as he bows his head to Scrimbo, his hands held together in front of him, fingers intertwined._

_Confused, and partially peeved by this, Scrimbo attempts to push him away, forgetting about his restraints._ "If you wanna kiss my ass so much, get me out of this dank shithole, you useless fuck."

_Homply giggles at Scrimbo's attempt to free himself._ "Oh, but that just can't happen... **I** won't let it." _Homply says as he reaches for an instrument on a table next to him, holding up a dull scalpel and beginning to take slow, methodical steps around Scrimbo._ "You must be cleansed... the chaos, the entropy, dormant inside this... _**vessel.**_" _He says with disgust, poking Scrimbo's side with the scalpel._ "You must be set free... **the God of Chaos** must rule once more."

_Reminded of his reoccurring nightmare, he starts viscerally shaking and scrambling to release himself, but alas; he cannot._ "Don't fuckin' touch me, you grimy piece of shit!"

"STAY **STILL!!**" _Homply screams, slamming Scrimbo's head onto the table with his grotesque hand. He is able to keep Scrimbo mostly restrained like this. Homply stares at Scrimbo, almost through him, into something unfamiliar._ "For your ascension, restlessness is not an option. This lesser frame they have trapped you in may fool you, but I'm not so ignorant." *He caresses the side of Scrimbo's head with his free hand, his breath stanky.* "Your Ichor is fresh.. ripe for extraction... ready for **reintroduction.** When that happens, you'll grow your crimson wings and fly far, far above it all... freeing us from this horrific loop." _He says with increasing anguish and passion, spittle flying from the deranged Homply._

_Even more confused by every word from the deranged man’s mouth, Scrimbo turns to his hand and bites down. Now, with his mouth clamped on his knuckles, he sinks deeper, breaking Homply’s hand fully, not leaving a single bone intact. His hand now flailing as if there was no bone at all to begin with._ “I said - LET ME GO!”

_From the pain, Homply screams loud enough to break glass. It's as if you can hear liquid seeping into his scream, gargling and desperately crying. He rips his hand away from Scrimbo, cradling it in his intact one, his screams of anguish turning to cries of despair. He takes a moment to heave in some air, processing the pain, collecting himself the best he can._ "My pain is only a speck in the grand scheme of our plans. Don't you know your heritage?" _He implores, now lingering just out of reach from Scrimbo._

_Snarking through the fear_ “All I know is your bitch ass better take these straps off, or next time, I’ll bite your face off too, creep.”

_Homply gives a toothy grin, laughing manically._ "I would recommend you stay still, it'll make this process so much easier." _He says, pulling a lever next to him. A machine above Scrimbo whirs to life, horrific in design, with one large mosquito like needle protruding from the center. With a rattle, it begins to inch closer._

_Reminded all too much of his nightmare, he tries not resisting, letting the machine puncture his skin, in pain, he lets out a few words with a twisted smile._ “I warned you to let me out, but now, you’ve got a big ol’ ass beating with your name on it when _they_ get here.”

 _Homply simply sits and stares at Scrimbo while this goes down._ "They? Even if someone were coming to your rescue, it would be too late... Anyway, it seems you've forgotten what you truly are... lucky you, because _**I**_ do. You, my god, are an Angel..."

“…Angel?” _Scrimbo begins to feel lightheaded, he is losing a LOT of blood_

"Angels are created by the gods to carry out their will here in the mortal plane. Angelhood is granted to those deemed worthy, and the worthy inherit a gift to henceforth carry out their divine purpose. You, the Chaos Angel, are more than _just_ an Angel... you're the **God** of Chaos, born to remove those who stand in the way of a Bophite's most divine purpose. What that is exactly, I don't know for sure myself... but I do know that the God of Chaos must be set free, your divinity from within to be reintroduced into the vessel that withholds your potential, your blood, your **Ichor.** Rest your eyes, weary one, for you will not be alive much longer to feel this pain. Now sleep, and let me serve my god." _Homply picks up a pipe from nearby and slams Scrimbo over the head, knocking him unconscious. He hits a large red button on the side of the machine, which swiftly injects most of the extracted Ichor back into Scrimbo's body._
