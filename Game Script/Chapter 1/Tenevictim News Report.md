Scene ID: 1.4.1

(Blimbus slumps down into his couch, grabbing the remote and clicking it on, TV static shining on his face.)

(Cut to TV view. Blimbus clicks through a few channels before stopping on JNN. The news reporter is beginning a new story. The camera slowly zooms on the TV while the report is given. TV Dinner begins to play now.)

n1: "Welcome back to JNN, the one and only source of news in the great Jimple City. I'm your host, Richard B. Stroganoff, and we have JUST been given another JUICY happening within Jimple."

(A picture of a happy looking Bophite is shown on screen.)
n2: "A young Bophite has been found killed in an alleyway next to a local breakfast diner, Donny's. Reports indicate that the innards of the young Bophite were scooped clean from his body." (Cut back to Blimbus' face, looking distraught.)

n3: "Investigators suspect foul play is involved. However, there are no fingerprints at the scene, just a dark residue left on the victims skin."

(The report starts decreasing in volume while TV Dinner fades in further, dolly zooming slowly on Blimbus' face.)

n4: "The residue is suspected to come from a nearby opening to the Jimple sewer network. A forensic team has been deployed to sample the substance and determine its origin. It is suspected that this black ooze is just sewer muck that the victim was poisoned with, though only time will tell. Blah Blah Blah blah blah... bla-blah... blah!"

(TV Dinner ends, Blimbus shakes his head, the camera returning to normal. Cut back to the TV)

n5: "And now onto more important news... SPOR-" (The TV clicks off, reflecting Blimbus off the black glass of the TV screen. It fades into an actual shot of Blimbus in an entirely black void aside from his couch.)

b1: "That... couldn't have been that silly black thing, could it?"

b2: "Ffffffffiddlesticks... I need to go back and stop this thing."
