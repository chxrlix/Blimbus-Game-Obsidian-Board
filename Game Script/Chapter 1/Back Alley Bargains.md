Scene ID: 1.4.1

**START OF SCENE**

(Blimbus rounds the corner of the alleyway, cautious and careful. The camera follows the side of him, watching as he turns into the entrance of the alley to spot a tall, obscured figure looming over the spot Blimbus shattered the bottle. Blimbus jumps, giving a small yelp while dashing out of view of the figure, unable to make out any color under the moonlight. The camera pans over without Blimbus to show the figure turned around, white eyes piercing through the dark to survey the entrance to the alley. It squints before dashing into a nearby door embedded in the wall of the alley, which slams shut.)

(Blimbus, alarmed, slowly walks back into the alley, noticing the figures absence and a curiously askew manhole in its place.)

b1: "Who..."

(Blimbus looks up at the door, which seems to be embedded in the wall as if it had been there for years. A weathered sign above reads in scratched black paint.)

b2: "Back Alley Bargains... odd." (He emphasizes every word, curious.)

(He goes to turn the doorknob, the camera focusing on his hand. He throws it open, the camera zooming back out to show the room inside devoid of any dark figure. Blimbus lingers for a moment before walking inside, closing the door politely behind him.)

Scene ID: 1.4.2

(The camera follows a walking shot of Blimbus as he looks around at the wares of Back Alley Bargains, coming to a slow stop when he notices the counter in front of him. We get a shot of just the desk, the sign from earlier brandished above a la Krusty Krab menu. There is a dingy rotary phone sitting on the counter and a rusty bell.) 

(The phone begins to ring, startling Blimbus, who turns around to leave. Curiously, however, the door Blimbus entered from is GONE?!?!?!?! Vanished as if it were never there in the first place. Blimbus hears the rattling of a doorknob, tensing up while he finds the source of the noise to be a door behind the front counter.)

(Camera does Mystery Man Entrance Sequence (Talk to Charlie later when storyboarding) showing Mystery Man opening the door, walking to the desk, and picking up the phone to answer.)

mm1: "Welcome to Back Alley Bargains, where you get your contraband cheap. What can I uh..."

(He trails off, having spotted Blimbus, a little bubble in the corner shows him starting to sweat.)

mm2: "Tell ya what, gimmie a ring in about 10 minutes, I'll discount ya for the wait. I've got a customer on-site who could use a little attention."  (He hangs up the phone, the camera emphasizing his fingers.)

**Change to Cutscene Dialogue**

mm3: "You there, chap in the blue, I'm sure I can skip the formalities, you having heard what this place is about and all."
mm4: "What can I do ya for?"

b2: "Oh no I'm not here to buy anything, just uh... where am I?"

mm5: "Can't you read a sign?"
mm6: "Back Alley Bargains, where you get your contraband cheap."

b3: "I'm not really in the market for contraband right now..."

mm7: "Good chatting then, you're free to leave whenever."
mm8: "If ya change your mind, I'm always sellin'." (He's turning to leave.)

b4: "Wait, sir..."
b5: "I um... saw you in the alleyway."

mm9: "Oh yeah, sorry if I startled ya."
mm10: "This is usually the time of night where I get out to do my dirty work."
mm11: "Or in this case... yours."

b6: "You... knew about that?"

(Mystery Man rummages underneath the counter, pulling out the shattered top of a bottle, the glass glowing softly.)

mm12: "Recognize this?"

b7: *Noises of confusion* "Yeah..."

mm13: "Last I checked, the ceaseless black monster I had trapped inside was still here."
mm14: "Do you see a ceaseless black monster inside this bottle?"

b8: "No..."

mm15: "And that's my problem now."

mm16: "See, that thing was stuck in this bottle for a very specific reason."
mm17: "Now, since you got it before I did, it's free to roam Jimple..."
mm18: "Making a meal out of anyone who gets close enough."

b9: "Oh gosh, what do I do?"

mm19: "Go after it, obviously."

b10: "I don't even know what "it" is, much less where to find it."

mm20: "Where I come from, we call this thing Tenebris."
mm21: "It has an unending hunger it can never seem to satisfy."
mm22: "It may start with just a couple unfortunate Bophites, but as it feeds, it grows."
mm23: "Bad news blues amigo, bluer than you I'm afraid."

b11: "How do I stop this... Tenebris thing?"

mm24: "It's... complicated."
mm25: "Focus on locating it first."
mm26: "Then, and only then, we'll tackle the whole defeating it thing."
mm27: "That is... if you even *want* to help."

b12: "Yes, of course I want to help!"
b13: "But, again, I don't even know where to start."

mm28: "Well, did you see it go anywhere?"

b14: "Yeah... after it started moving it slunk into the..."
b15: "Oh my gosh the sewer."

mm29: "There ya' go, kid."
mm30: "Objective #1."
(Mystery Man fluffs a newspaper in his face, ignoring Blimbus for the remainder of the cutscene.)

b16: "But how do I-"
b17: "Nevermind."

**End of Cutscene Dialogue**

(Blimbus turns around to find a way out, and mysteriously, the door has reappeared. He walks out, taking a look at the open sewer manhole, gulping.)
