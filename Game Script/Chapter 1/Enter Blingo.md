Scene ID: 1.8.1

**START OF SCENE**

(Scrimbo slowly opens his eyes, his head pounding and his vision blurry. He tried to move his limbs but seems to be in a state of sleep paralysis. He has limited movement of his head, looking around at the white void surrounding... whatever.)

(Looking down at his body, he sees shapeless black figures swaying and swirling into each other as he comes to. When his vision clears up just a little bit, we see a singular dark figure looming over Scrimbo's body. It raises a blurry appendage, forming into a VERY CLEAR 4 fingered RIGHT HAND. 
It slowly reaches that hand down onto Scrimbo's chest, pushing it's fingers inside and pulling apart to reveal his chest cavity. As this happens, the void around him and the figure swap colors while a shaft of red and gold light begin to emit from Scrimbo's chest. The figure charges it's hand back before plunging it into Scrimbo's chest. His entire vision is white as we hear a low grumbly voice amidst the harsh atmospheric noise.)

st1: "You are mine, and mine alone."

(A shrill alarm begins to cut through the atmosphere, overtaking the music and ambiance.)

(HARSH CUTOFF)

**START OF SCENE**

(Scrimbo jolts awake to the sound of a blaring alarm and a commanding pounding from his front door. He scrunches his face and blinks, groaning loudly. He looks to his alarm, scowling and slamming it into his nightstand, breaking it in the process.)

(Still in his nightgown, he walks to his front door, rubbing his face with his hand, with his other on the doorknob. He opens it, and Blingo's theme begins to play.)

(The camera pans from the bottom of Blingo to the top, showing off his... bling, and zooming out to show his two henchmen behind him, Scrimbo in the corner of the screen.)

bl1: "SCRIMBO!!!"
bl2: "You look like shit."

s1: "You woke me up." 

bl3: "The rent?" 

s2: *Sigh* "Listen man, I don't have all of it, if you could just give me a couple days-"

bl4: "Now you better listen buddy, I make the rules, and the rules SAY you gotta have your rent... right now."
bl5: "Shivlad, tell him what we do to scrubs who pay their rent late." 

(He gestures over his shoulder at a tall Bophite, Shivlad. He cracks his knuckles, grunting at Scrimbo, who gives a confused expression in response, sharing a look with a smug Blingo.

"You'll get yer ass beat." Blingo says, his smile dropped.
"You're supposed to say- ugh nevermind." Blingo says to Shivlad, he continues.
"Point is, rent's due, Scrimbo, but since I'm so nice, I'll give you a *small* extension." Blingo says while putting a hand on Scrimbo's shoulder, who whacks it off to absolutely no reaction from Blingo. (This will become a running joke)

"Yeah, whatever, I'll have it in a few days, promise." Scrimbo says dismissively, beginning to walk away and shut the door. It's ripped from his hands by Blingo's other henchman, to which Scrimbo curses him.

"You *will* have your rent, by THIS TIME next week... or an eviction notice will be the last thing you got to worry about." Blingo says with a smug grin on his face. 

Scrimbo slouches, sighing. "Yup, thanks Blingo."

"Awesome, later loser." Blingo says, a beat after before Blingo elbows his henchman, who slams Scrimbo's door in response. Scrimbo flinches, left staring at his door, dumbfounded and exhausted.

"How does a guy get his own fucking door slammed in his face?" Scrimbo says to himself in disbelief.
