Scene ID: 1.8.1

**START OF SCENE**

(Scrimbo takes a few steps forward before stopping. The air feels off. He glances conspiratorially over his shoulder, then around at the empty street. Too quiet. He clenches his fist and walks forward, stopped only a few steps into his stride by a large figure coming from the corner of an alley. Scrimbo scrambles back, throwing his hands up, watching two other figures walk out from behind the large man. The camera pans down to show Blingo, a smug smile on his face, while his theme whirs to life like a wind up music box.)

bl1: "If it ain't my old pal, big S, Scrimbonator!"
bl2: "Still ugly as ever."
bl3: "How's ur pops, still broke?" (He laughs like a bitch.)

s1: "Blingo... still hiding behind stick and stone here, eh?"
s2: "Means you're too scared to face me yourself, prick." (He leans down to Blingo's level, the two sharing an angry scowl.)

bl4: "Hoh-hoh, someone's pissy today, mm?" 

(Blingo snaps, and the larger of the two henchman shove Scrimbo off.)

bl5: "Oh Shivlad!"
bl6: "Why don't you show our friend here what we do to PUNKS who just never seem to LEARN THEIR PLACE?!"

(The thinner of the two flick open a switchblade from his back pocket, brandishing it while walking slowly toward Scrimbo. He holds the knife up, not exactly at Scrimbo, but threateningly enough for Scrimbo to lean back out of it.)

sh1: "The rent."
sh2: "He uh... he wants the rent..."
sh3: "That's really all he needs. yeah..."

(Shivlad smiles politely at Scrimbo, who looks at Blingo dumbfounded. Blingo, clearly pissed off now, crosses his arms.)

bl7: "SHIVLAD, you- UGH!!!"
bl8: "If I have to do everything myself..."

(Blingo walks up, shoving Shivlad out of the way and grabbing his knife, pointing it directly at Scrimbo this time.)

bl9: "You've got till this time next week, Scrub."
bl10: "I don't take kindly to my tenants paying me late."
bl11: "And if you think **IM** ugly... wait 'till you meet my boss."

(He pauses for a beat before tossing the knife behind him, Shivlad scrambling to pick it up in the background while Blingo speaks.)

bl12: "I gotta say, Scrimbo, you're lucky."
bl13: "You caught me in a good mood, and for that, I'll let you off this time with a small beating."
bl14: "Y'know, to remind you why you should pay up on time."

(Blingo lets out a "heh" before turning around, waving his hand to signal his goons to fight.)

bl15: "See ya soon, SCUMbo!" (He giggles to himself as he walks away.)

(Scrimbo walks backward while the goons walk toward him, his hands held up cautiously as if to deter them.)

s3: "Seriously, why do you still work for him?"
s4: "He's an ass, and thats saying something coming frOM ME- FGHH!!"

(He is cut off by a punch in the face from Bro, this changes cleanly into gameplay.)
