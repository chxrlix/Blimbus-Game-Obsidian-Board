**START OF SCENE

(Blimbus does a 3 point landing, pausing for dramatic effect before whipping his head up and smacking it on the back of a post. Pain and anguish occur for a couple seconds before he scrambles to his feet and runs off.)

(Blimbus runs up to the entrance of Donny's, walking up to the door, but stopping as he sees a sign that reads "Donny's out, be back in 10." Cut to the same view of Blimbus at the end of the previous sequence, looking disheveled and worn.)

b1: "Yeah. Ok. Be back in 10." (He says while walking away,)

(From a side view, Blimbus walks down the street, looking bummed. As he passes a dark alley, a flash of bright white light emits, drawing his attention.)

(Botulism begins to play.)

(Blimbus stops, looking behind him at the alley, all ambiance stops here aside from a low, hollow drone. He walks up to the entrance of the alley, the camera behind him dolly zooming to stretch the entrance.)

b2: "I'm gonna walk down this mysterious alleyway." (The camera smoothly zooms into gameplay, where you walk down the alleyway, the camera getting more and more fucked up in the process. Once you reach the end, the camera effects go away.)

(On the ground is a bottle with glowing white edges, filled with a black liquid that seems to cut off any light. There is a dingy metal cap on the top. Blimbus kneels down, gently picks it up, and rolls it in his hand, seeing no apparent label. He stands up, dumbfounded.)

b3: "Weird..."

(The bottle shakes in his hand, causing him to yelp and drop it, where it shatters on the floor, spilling the black liquid across the dirty concrete. It is viscous in nature, and has a slight sheen from the light refracting off it. Blimbus looks concerned, but has no words.)

(The liquid on the ground rolls, seeps together almost, trying to form a small stalk to hold itself up, but failing, splatting back on the ground. Needle thin tendrils stretch out swiftly toward the shards of glowing broken glass, taking hold for just a second before sucking them in as quick as it has reached out to them, following shortly by a sickening crunch and small expansion of the creature's frame.)

(The camera cuts to a shot from the side showing both the creature and Blimbus, who is still standing, observing.)

b4: "What... are you? Can you hear me?"

(The creature jiggles, lurching to life to roll forward just slightly, then barreling down toward the entrance of the alley, going between Blimbus' legs. Blimbus whips his head around to watch the creature as it collides with an unfortunate animal walking past the entrance to the alley, pausing for a moment before slinking like a rotund snake in front of Blimbus, who wearily takes a step back.)

(The creature stretches up, creating a thick stalk, before bits of itself spill out into a bean like shape, liquid inside bubbling, before an eye peeks to its surface, rolling to face Blimbus. Tenebris Common Form.)

(Blimbus lets out a nervous chuckle.) b5: "You're um... a cute little thing, hmm?"

(The creature blinks heavily, tilting it's head at Blimbus, inspecting him, before slinking quietly toward the wall of the alley and into a drainage grate. Blimbus is left dumbfounded, sitting alone in the alley.)

b6: "Well... I guess that happened." 

(Blimbus' stomach rumbles. Only realizing now how hungry he is, he smacks his lips.)

b7: "Guess watching that goopy black thing absorb a Quinch worked up an appetite."
b8: "I'll just head back to Donny's now." (Blimbus begins to walk off.)
