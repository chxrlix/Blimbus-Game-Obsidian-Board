B: “I think this is where I need to be, judging by the goopy black residue around the rim of this manhole.”  
  
(You hear a manhole opening sound and are in the sewer now, where you walk in the direction of goopy black shit. After a short while you see an enemy, and it takes you into the combat UI, where you will inevitably get hit, and we get into a cutscene of Blimbus being knocked on his ass, looking up and seeing Mystery Man bent over in front of him.)  
  
MM: “You’re really just gonna waltz in here with no preparation?”  
  
B: rubbing his head “That’s what you told me to do, wasn’t it?!”  
  
MM: pausing for a moment, shrugging “Fair enough."
  
(Blimbus stands up and adjusts himself, looking at the creature and then back at Mystery man)  
  
B: “Well, Tenebris’ probably down there, but there’s a bunch of Slurches blocking my way… what do I do now?”  
  
MM: “Punch that fucker.”  
  
(Blimbus has a >:/ face then holds his fists up, stepping forward)  
  
(Combat UI, you get close to the enemy and a portrait of mystery man stares at YOU the player and says “Psst, that’s your cue to press (keybind)”)  
  
Upon killing first enemy MM: “You got it! Just keep doing that and you’ll be fine.”
