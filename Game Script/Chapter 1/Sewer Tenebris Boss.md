**START OF SCENE**

(Blimbus walks into the room wearily, wiping his cheek free of goop. He stops dead in his tracks, his face contorting in horror, unable to even comprehend whatever he's looking at. The camera does a FULL ANIMATED TURNAROUND to show the first Prime Darknest.)

Camera is now fully disconnected from Blimbus, focusing mostly on Tenebris.

(Tenebris is hunched over in front of the Darknest, twitching sporadically while the Darknest beats like a faux heart. We cut back to Blimbus, who starts breathing heavy, swallowing before speaking.)

b1: "Found it." (His breath is rough.)

(Cut back to Tenebris for a moment. We're given a side view of Tenebris, still slightly shaking. Big bro lurches its head back in an arch, its eye sinking into its head. The weight of its head causes it to lurch backward, the eye popping out perfectly to stare at Blimbus, the camera zooming out cleanly with the arch. We cut to a back view of Tenebris, mirroring the back view of Blimbus showing the Darknest from earlier.) 

(The screen cuts to black for a moment, cutting back to show Tenebris halfway launched toward Blimbus, who steps away just in time to let Tenebris zoom past him. Tenebris slams into the ground, pivoting and launching himself back toward Blimbus. Blimbus, panicking, takes a sharp breath and throws his fist into Tenebris. His hand goes right through Tenebris head, sticking inside it while the rest of Tenebris body stretches past.)

(Everything goes still for a moment before Tenebris eye pops up to the surface, looking at Blimbus' hand. It does this one more time from the opposite side before teeth start to rise up, ready to bite. Blimbus makes a noise and pulls his hand out, Tenebris head elastically shooting back to his body. We get a closeup of Tenebris snarling, teeth out, dripping with goop. It cuts back to Blimbus, who lets out a sigh.)

b2: "Can't hit it directly, gotcha."
b3: "I'll find a way."

Tenebris Boss Fight Ensues

Scene ID: 1.6.2

**START OF SCENE**

(The metal pipe from above swings and slams into the Darknest, the whole thing writing and beginning to shrivel. The whole catwalk shakes, Blimbus managing to keep his balance.)

(Tenebris launches two tentacles that wrap around Blimbus, squeezing hard resulting in a scream from Blimbus. The camera shows Blimbus' POV, his vision blurring while he looks around for a solution. He spots the edge of the catwalk, a shot of his face getting a determined look.)

b1: "If I'm going down..."

(Blimbus grabs Tenebris best he can, planting his feet firm.)

b2: "THEN YOU'RE GOING DOWN WITH ME!!!"

(The catwalk begins to give, Blimbus throwing himself toward the edge of it, Tenebris being dragged along with. They roll together off the edge of the catwalk, the camera fading to black as the music swells to completion. In the midst of the black screen, we hear a sickening impact.)

(The Blue Man Is No More starts to play.)

(We get a couple shots of the broken down sewer. The catwalk crumbled, the Darknest shriveled, the lack of ambiance aside from flowing water. With the drop of the song, the camera cuts to see Blimbus' limp body lying on a slant, a black smear under the water that runs around him. His arms are clearly shattered, he has scuffs all over his body. Black tendrils begin to gently envelop parts of his body, the camera beginning to blur while we hear an alarm fade into the song. As the camera now fades to black, the alarm becomes all that we hear.)
