Scene ID: 1.12.1

**START OF SCENE**

(Scrimbo is trapped at the entrance to the sewer, unable to climb up the broken ladder. He starts breathing heavier as Malignant Blimbus draws closer.)

s1: "Shit."
s2: "Shit, shit, SHIT!!!"

(The camera follows Malignant Blimbus' POV, showing him sprint out of the sewer tunnel and lunging at Scrimbo. The camera cuts to a floor shot of Malignant Blimbus on top of Scrimbo, one clawed hand gipping Scrimbo's head while Blimbus' body is held up limp. Scrimbo grabs at the claw, trying desperately to throw him off, but failing.)

(Blimbus' body slumps back, his head aimed toward the ceiling. He convulses a few times before Tenebris begins to slink out of his head, his beady eye staring straight into Scrimbo. Scrimbo's eyes go wide, unable to comprehend whatever the hell is going on.)

(The light from the sewer opening becomes obscured for a moment, a tall dark figure landing into the chamber shortly after. Mystery Man comes into view, gearing up to punch Tenebris out of Blimbus. Tenebris splats on the wall nearby, squealing and writhing into a crack in the wall.)

(Blimbus, now free of Tenebris, slumps over onto the ground next to Scrimbo, already looking a little better. Scrimbo gets up and dusts himself off, still breathing heavy.)

s3: "Who... are you?" (He asks between haggard breaths.)

(Mystery man stands straight up, back to Scrimbo. He turns his head, the camera zooming in to show his one white eye piercing the darkness.)

mm1: "We've got a lot of work to do."
