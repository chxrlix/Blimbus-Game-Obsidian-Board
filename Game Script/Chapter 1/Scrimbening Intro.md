Scene ID: 1.7.1

**START OF SCENE**

(All ambiance cuts out, the camera focused on a tacky looking alarm clock. A white fingered hand pokes the top a few times. After noticing it still on, the hand slams it once, pausing for a moment before grabbing it ferociously. The hand, connected to Scrimbo, throws the alarm across his room, it smashing against a wall and falling into a box full of identical broken alarm clocks.)

s1: "Every. Fucking. Time."
s2: "Why'd I think today would be different?" 

(He looks over to a cabinet left ajar, countless boxes showing identical clocks.)

(We get a shot from inside his closet, the door opening and shirts ruffling as Scrimbo looks through his catalogue of red shirts. Scrimbo puts on the shirt and the camera zooms down to his feet as he walks to the side, smoothly transitioning to him walking out his front door. We get a panoramic shot of Crime Street, showing the disrepair it is in. He sighs, puts his hands in his pockets, and walks out of frame.)
