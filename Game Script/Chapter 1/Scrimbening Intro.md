Setting: Scrimbo is just now "waking up," he is in a desolate white void overlooking nothing. He sees the hazy form of a figure in front of him and has cannot move his body. He is laying down floating on nothing with his limbs splayed outward loosely.

Scrimbo slowly opens his eyes, his head pounding and his vision blurry. He tried to move his limbs but seems to be in a state of sleep paralysis. He has limited movement of his head, looking around at the white void surrounding... whatever.

Looking down at his body, he sees shapeless black figures swaying and swirling into each other as he comes to. When his vision clears up just a little bit, we see a singular dark figure looming over Scrimbo's body. It raises a blurry appendage, forming into a VERY CLEAR 4 fingered RIGHT HAND. 
It slowly reaches that hand down onto Scrimbo's chest, pushing it's fingers inside and pulling apart to reveal his chest cavity. As this happens, the void around him and the figure swap colors while a shaft of red and gold light begin to emit from Scrimbo's chest. The figure charges it's hand back before plunging it into Scrimbo's chest. His entire vision is white as we hear a low grumbly voice amidst the harsh atmospheric noise.

"You are mine, and mine alone."
