Scene ID: 1.9.1

**START OF SCENE**

(We get a shot from behind the counter seeing the door open and Scrimbo walking in.)

s1: "I'm here, dad."

d1: "Scrimbo, my son."
d2: "Good to have ya here today."
d3: "Your usual again?"

s1: "Yup."

(Scrimbo sits down at his signature stool, sighing as if he's deflating like a balloon. Donny sets down a plate of eggs and an open bottle in front of Scrimbo, who stares at it blankly.)

d4: "Had it waitin' for ya."
d5: "I could sense you were comin'."

s2: "Thanks, pops." 

(Scrimbo starts chowing down on his eggs, his other hand around the bottle. He sets his fork down, the plate swiftly half empty, taking a swig of the bottle to wash it down. He sets the bottle down and... ever so faintly... smiles. He catches himself, shakes his head, and looks down at the row of stools sat up next to the counter. Oddly, Blimbus is nowhere to be found.)

s3: "It's... real peaceful in here actually."
s4: "Too peaceful."

d6: "While I was cookin' your chow, I went ahead and warmed up your buddies usual."
d7: "He comes in every morning, but just as I was finished I saw on the news the kid went missing."
d8: "A shame really, I like having him around."

s5: "What?"
s6: "Missing?"

d9: "Yeah, him and a couple others."
d10: "They suspect it's got something to do with this new string of killings."
d11: "The Dark Prince, real dumb sounding name."

s7: "What kinda fuckin' edgy name is the Dark Prince?"

d12: "That's what I said!"
d13: "Anyway, they're offerin' a cash reward for any news on the guy or the suspected dead."

(A thought bubble forms above Scrimbo's head.)

(Blingo + No Money = Dead Scrimbo)
(Blimbus + Found = Money)
(Blingo + Blimbus = Happy)

(The thought bubble pops, Scrimbo beginning to walk away.)

s8: "Thanks for the tip, dad."
s9: "I'm gonna go snoop a bit."

d14: "In case you run into him."

(Donny throws the bagel to Scrimbo, who catches it and looks at it, confused.)

d15: "He likes em' stale sometimes, I dunno."

(Shot of Scrimbo outside Donny's. He closes the door, takes a gnarly bite out of the bagel, then throws it over his shoulder.)

s10: "Alright, lets get this dough."
