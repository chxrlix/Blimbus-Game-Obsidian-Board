(The camera focuses on the bell on the Donny's door, watching it ring as it opens. There is ambient clamoring of people eating and speaking, with a small montage showing how packed the diner is. We get a shot of the whole interior, then the door slams open with Blimbus in an instant profuse apology.)

b1: "Donny I'm so sorry, I really really am, this will never happen again, I promise, I'm so sorry!!"

(He stops at the counter, Donny looking at him confused.)

d1: "Well howdy Blimbus... and sorry for what?"

b2: "I owed you a favor and didn't show up on time... I was late..." (He admits, slumping on the counter in defeat.)

d2: "Oh! yeah that..." (Donny says as if he had just remembered it.)
d3: "So I guess that means you just owe me another, eh?" (He says with a hearty chuckle.)

(Blimbus instantly rebounds back to happy.)
