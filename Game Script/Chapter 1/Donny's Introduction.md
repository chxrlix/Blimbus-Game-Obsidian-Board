Scene ID: 1.3.1

**START OF SCENE

(The camera focuses on the bell on the Donny's door, watching it ring as it opens. There is ambient clamoring of people eating and speaking, with a small montage showing how packed the diner is. We get a shot of the whole interior, then the door slams open with Blimbus in an instant profuse apology.)

b1: "Donny I'm so sorry, I really really am, this will never happen again, I promise, I'm so sorry!!"

(He stops at the counter, Donny looking at him confused.)

d1: "Well howdy Blimbus... and sorry for what?"

b2: "I owed you a favor and didn't show up on time... I was late..." (He admits, slumping on the counter in defeat.)

d2: "Oh! yeah that..." (Donny says as if he had just remembered it.)
d3: "So I guess that means you just owe me another, eh?" (He says with a hearty chuckle.)

(Blimbus instantly rebounds back to happy.)

b3: "Oh yay!!! Thank you Donny, thank you so much!"

d4: "No prob, Bob... you want your usual?"

b4: "Yeah, one plain bagel, extra plain please!"

d5: "Be out soon, take a seat bub."

(Side view of Blimbus, the camera shifts to show Scrimbo sitting on a bar stool with an unmarked bottle in his hand, a stack of pancakes in front of him. I H8 U begins to play. He has a fork stabbed into his pancakes, using the handle to hold himself up like a knight gripping a sword.)

(Switch to an over the counter view. Blimbus falls into the seat and bounces a little bit.)

b5: "Well hello there Scrimbo!" (Said with overly enthusiastic emphasis on each word.)

(Scrimbo's neck shakily creaks upward, hearing a comical door hinge as his eyes are cursed with this stupid blue thing.)

s1: "What. Do you want...?" (Through gritted teeth)

b6: "Just asking how my best pal Scrimbo is doing!" (He says, putting an arm on Scrimbo's shoulder, to which he boils to full red like a tea kettle. Scrimbo shakes his head, throwing Blimbus' arm off.)

s2: "FIRST OFF!! Not your friend... second off, I'm doing just. **fine.**" (With each of the last words, he raises his bottle over his head, then chucks it full force behind the counter. The camera cuts to Donny, who leans out of the way just in time, the bottle colliding with the wall behind Donny, sticking into it. The drywall around it cracks and crumbles into dust, to which Donny looks at it and goes,)

d6: "Shucks, I really need to get that wall fixed." [Wall Fix 4 You. To Punch as Scrimbo Later "This wall was too fixed to break."]

(Cut back to Scrimbo, who's standing in his chair, a foot on the counter.)

s3: "SHUT THE FUCK UP DAD I HATE YOU!!!"

(Offscreen) d7: "Love you too son!"

(Scrimbo slumps back into his seat, pulling an identical bottle out of his pocket.)

b7: "You're the funniest guy I know." (He says with a laugh.)

s4: "Let me tell you a joke then." (He says with a scant smile, slamming a newspaper on the table in front of them.)

s5: "Some little shit got popped in the back of an alley or something, ain't really sure what happened to em', but legend has it, the killer's hungry for a... blue little **dumbass** like yourself." (He jokes with a grin.)

(Blimbus fake laughs, trickling off into him just blankly staring at Scrimbo. It just pans back and forth between Blimbus' deadpan face and Scrimbo's smug one, slowly shifting to the same deadpan expression.)

b8: "I don't get it."

(Glass break sound.)

s6: "FUCK this noise, and fuck you too." (Scrimbo says, getting up from his seat and taking a long swig of his bottle, rummaging in one of his pockets while doing so.)

(Birds eye view of the table.)

s7: "Here, make yourself useful." (He says while slamming his check on the counter in front of Blimbus, walking away after.)

(The ambiance and dialogue of Donny's slowly begins to muffle, zooming in slowly on the newspaper. We can hear Donny faintly.)

d7: "Goodbye son, be back before dinner!! *pause* Blimbus... Blimbus?"

(Counter view of Blimbus spacing out while staring at the newspaper.)

d8: "BLIMBUS!!! Bagel's ready." (Noise cuts back in, Blimbus jumps in surprise while Donny walks away.)

b9: "... I think I'll just take this to go."

(Blimbus manhandles the bagel with one hand, paper tray and all, and grabs the newspaper with the other hand, walking off while the screen fades to black.)
