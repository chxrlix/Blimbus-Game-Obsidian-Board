(Blimbus walks into Donny’s, giving a large breath to take in the Donny’s air.)  
  
B: “Ah… what a smelly smell.”  
B: “I don’t have a nose.”  
  
(As Blimbus walks past the camera, we focus and zoom onto Scrimbo, who looks over to Blimbus and sighs. Blimbus takes a seat next to Scrimbo while waving happily.)  
  
B: “Mornin’ Scrimbo!”  
  
S: “Fuck off.”  
  
B: “What’s my best friend up to on this splendiferous da-!”  
  
S: “First off, not your friend.”  
S: “Secondly, if you don’t leave me the hell alone, the only thing that will be ‘up…’
  
(Scrimbo holds up a bottle of adult beverage.)  
  
S: “Is this bottle… in your ass.”  
  
(Blimbus stares at him blankly before bursting out into laughter, putting his hand on Scrimbo’s shoulder while he speaks, not reacting when he slaps it off.)
  
B: “You’re the funniest guy I know!”  
  
(Scrimbo slides his check to Blimbus, flipping him off while he walks out.)  
  
S: “Here, make yourself useful.”  
  
B: “Y-Yeah, I got it bud!”

(Blimbus eats his meal, pays for both, and you have the option to leave or have silly food and talk to everyone in the joint. Upon exiting Donny’s, Blimbus says to himself)  
  
B: “Ah, I’m simply stuffed!”
B: “Time to peruse the city at a leisurely pace!”
B: “Woah… I sounded smart or something.”
