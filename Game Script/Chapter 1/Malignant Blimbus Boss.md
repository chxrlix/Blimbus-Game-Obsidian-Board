**START OF SCENE**

(We get an establishing shot showing Scrimbo walking into the decrepit room containing Blimbus and the Darknest. The camera scurries away as if connected to a creature, which then pans to a side shot of Scrimbo.)

s1: "If I came all the way down here for nothin', I'm gonna..." (He thinks for a moment.)
s2: "I don't know what I'm gonna do, but it's not gonna be good."

(The camera quick cuts to a puddle on the ground disturbed, quick cutting back to Scrimbo who whips his whole body around to see the source of the noise. The camera moves to show Blimbus standing with his back to Scrimbo, slouched over lazily.)

s3: "DUDE!!!"
s4: "You scared the shit out of me, fuck!!"

(Blimbus stands there silent, Scrimbo swallows before starting to walk slowly toward him, the camera on a side cut of the room.)

s5: "Everyone in Jimple's got their noses twisted tryna look for you and the other folks that got up and went missing."
s6: "D'you have any idea how bad of a joke this is?"

(Blimbus is still silent. The camera focuses on Scrimbo, who's starting to look annoyed.)

s7: "I'm all for being a jerk, but this just ain't like you."
s8: "So if you don't start talking, I'm gonna come over there and beat your ass, understand?"

(Camera focuses on Blimbus, who is still silent.)
