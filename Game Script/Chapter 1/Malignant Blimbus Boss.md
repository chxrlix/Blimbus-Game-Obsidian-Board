Scene ID: 1.11.1

**START OF SCENE**

(We get an establishing shot showing Scrimbo walking into the decrepit room containing Blimbus and the Darknest. The camera scurries away as if connected to a creature, which then pans to a side shot of Scrimbo.)

s1: "If I came all the way down here for nothin', I'm gonna..." (He thinks for a moment.)
s2: "I don't know what I'm gonna do, but it's not gonna be good."

(The camera quick cuts to a puddle on the ground disturbed, quick cutting back to Scrimbo who whips his whole body around to see the source of the noise. The camera moves to show Blimbus standing with his back to Scrimbo, slouched over lazily.)

s3: "DUDE!!!"
s4: "You scared the shit out of me, fuck!!"

(Blimbus stands there silent, Scrimbo swallows before starting to walk slowly toward him, the camera on a side cut of the room.)

s5: "Everyone in Jimple's got their noses twisted tryna look for you and the other folks that got up and went missing."
s6: "D'you have any idea how bad of a joke this is?"

(Blimbus is still silent. The camera focuses on Scrimbo, who's starting to look annoyed.)

s7: "I'm all for being a jerk, but this just ain't like you."
s8: "So if you don't start talking, I'm gonna come over there and beat your ass, understand?"

(Camera focuses on Blimbus, who is still silent. Cut back to Scrimbo.)

s9: "Okay that's it."

(Scrimbo walks out of frame. The camera cuts back to Blimbus, interrupted by Scrimbo walking over and putting his hand on his shoulder. As he does this, Blimbus' head jerks around to face Scrimbo, as if flung by some external force. His eyes are white and glossy, and his mouth is leaking black fluid. He has a gnarly crack on the top of his head that is oozing the same black fluid. Scrimbo screams and falls back, scooting away on the sewer floor.)

s10: "WHAT THE FUCK???"

(The camera focuses from Scrimbo's POV. Blimbus turns his whole body, his feet still planted in the same direction. He holds this pose for a second before his feet walk to face the proper direction, his body swaying as if it's only being led from one weight point at a time. While this goes on, we hear Scrimbo breathing heavy, muttering "oh my god" and "what the fuck" and "what happened to him.")

(The camera cuts to the side of Blimbus, focused on his arms. Black goop seeps from the tops of his arms and begins to coat them. Blimbus slowly hunches over, the goop acting as a bone to hold them up in a curve before thickening to become the signature claws of Malignant Blimbus.)

(The camera cuts to a front view of Malignant Blimbus, his body convulsing slightly. Black goops spits from his mouth, and we see his mouth open and these words come out.)

mb: "Found it."
