Scene ID: 1.1.1

**START OF CHAPTER**

(We open on a bright blue sky, clouds strewn about a beaming sun. There is small lush ambiance featuring swaying foliage and the chirping of small animals. The camera pans down to a birds eye view of Jimple City, block zooming onto a small street, further to a small house, then to a floor view of the front door of the house.)

(B starts to fade in)

(The door opens, the camera panning up on a blue clad lad with a large smile across his face. His voice rings out as a voiceover on top of the following events.)

b1: "My name... is Blimbus, Blimbus B. Blimbleblam." (His eyes are closed, he takes a deep breath and opens them, walking out of the door.)

b2: "I'm a happy guy! Friends with everyone, humbly generous, I try to be reliable!" (Blimbus walks down his street, waving at the rest of the Bophites walking down, who wave back happily.)

b3: "I may not have a nose... or hair... or really just be the most normal looking Bophite around, but to me, that doesn't change a thing." (A small montage of weird Bophites on the street.)

b4: "Overall though, I just want to fit in!" (Blimbus walking, smiling.)

b5: "So when my pal Donny called in a favor, I was first on the scene!" (Back view of Blimbus, cut to his smiling face, cut to the same smiling face in his bathroom mirror. B ends.)

b6: "If I wasn't horribly late."

(An alarm on an old looking phone rings on the edge of his sink. "Reminder, your activity: TOILS FOR PANCAKE MAN starts in 5 minutes!")

b7: "Oh...!"
b8: "FFFFFFFIDDLESTICKS, I'M GONNA BE LATE!!!"

(B² starts playing as a montage ensues that mirrors the prior sequence. He rushes out of the door, bumping into a few Bophites that he waved to in the earlier montage. While he runs down the road, the camera pans back up to the sky, where the logo for the game fades onscreen.)

(B² ends as the screen fades to black.)

Scene ID: 1.1.2

(The camera pans to the side as if it were aimed at the dark wall of an alley, showing Blimbus sprinting down the road. It cuts to a side tracking view of Blimbus, who runs into a temporary sign pole. He looks up to see "UNDER CONSTRUCTION.")

b9: "Noooooo no no-" (He says, looking around frantically, spotting a Bophite in a hard hat and reflective gear.)

b10: "Hey there ma'am! Do you think there's any way I could get through this construction, I promised a friend I'd help him out in a few minutes, and his joint is... RIGHT past where you guys are building." (Blimbus says with a chuckle, trying to stay as lighthearted as possible.)

w1: "Unless you can climb your way through, which I don't advise, you're square out of luck, bluebud." (She says, Blimbus exhaling.)

(We get a shot of Blimbus stepping up to the construction, resting on his face, determined.)

b11: "This shouldn't be too bad..."
